# Mercado Livre clone with React.js

## Project's Scope
I wanted to create something resembling an e-commerce in this project. Here, you can search for anything (since the API apparently has everything you can imagine), view all the products listed in cards, check their main information, add them to the cart, and view the cart itself with the total amount you're purchasing. All the state management was done using ContextAPI. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to create a single page for each product yet. Despite that, I hope you like it!

* Display main product information in cards
* Add items to the cart
* Delete items from the cart
* Search for any product
* View your total
* Responsive design
